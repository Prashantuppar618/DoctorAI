# DoctorAI 🤖🩺

DoctorAI is an intelligent healthcare assistant that predicts diseases based on user-input symptoms using Machine Learning (ML). It enhances accessibility to preliminary diagnosis and medical suggestions, aiming to support patients before visiting a healthcare provider.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Disease prediction based on symptoms using ML/AI
- 💊 Suggests possible medicines or home remedies
- 👨‍⚕️ Recommends relevant specialist doctors
- 🧪 Suggests tests if required
- 🎙️ Accepts both text and voice inputs
- 🌐 Frontend built with React, backend with Flask
- 🔗 Connected to a trained ML model using `.pkl` files

## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

### Backend (Flask)
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
````

### Frontend (React)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## 📊 Dataset

A custom or publicly available dataset with symptoms and diseases (CSV format) was used to train the ML model. The model maps user symptoms to likely diseases using classification algorithms.

## 🤖 Model Used

* Decision Tree / Random Forest (customizable)
* Vectorizer for symptom encoding
* Accuracy depends on dataset quality

## 🧪 Future Enhancements

* BERT/NLP integration for raw text understanding
* Patient history tracking
* Smart chatbot integration
* Firebase/MongoDB for user records
